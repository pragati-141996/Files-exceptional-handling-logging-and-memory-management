        "-  Interpreted languages execute the source code line-by-line at runtime using an interpreter without creating a standalone executable (e.g., Python, JavaScript).\n",
        "-  Compiled languages translate the entire source code into machine code before execution using a compiler, creating a separate executable file (e.g., C, C++)\n",

        "2. What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that happen during the execution of a program. Instead of crashing the program when an error occurs, Python lets you catch and handle the error using special keywords like try, except, else, and finally.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  The finally block is used to define code that will always run, no matter what happens — whether an exception was raised or not. It is typically used for clean-up actions, like closing files, releasing resources, or ending a database connection.\n",

        "4. What is logging in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Logging in Python means recording messages that describe what the program is doing while it runs. Instead of using print(), you use the logging module to track events like errors, warnings, or important steps in your program. These messages can be shown on the screen or saved to a file.\n",

        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "-  The import statement is used to bring an entire module into our code.We access the functions or classes within that module by using the module's name as a prefix.\n",

        "\n",
        "-  You can handle multiple exceptions in Python in the following ways:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Using multiple except blocks** : Each type of exception is handled separately with its own except block.This allows us to provide a specific response for each different error.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Catching multiple exceptions in a single except block** : We can group several exceptions together and handle them with one except block.\n",
        "This is useful when we want to respond the same way to different types of errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Using a generic except block** : We can catch all exceptions using a general except clause.This is helpful when we want to handle any unexpected error, but it should be used carefully because it might hide programming mistakes.\n",

        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python ?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  The with statement is used to simplify file handling by automatically managing the opening and closing of files. It ensures that a file is properly closed after its operations are completed, even if an error occurs during the process. This helps prevent resource leaks and makes the code cleaner and more readable.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing ?\n",
        "\n",

        "-  **Better than Print Statements**\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "-  Memory management in Python refers to the process of efficiently handling and organizing a program’s memory during its execution. It includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Automatic Memory Allocation : Python automatically allocates memory to objects when they are created.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Garbage Collection : Python has a built-in garbage collector that automatically frees up memory by removing objects that are no longer used (i.e., objects without any references).\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Reference Counting : Every object in Python has a reference count, which tracks how many references point to the object. When the count drops to zero, the memory can be reclaimed.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Memory Pools : Python internally manages memory using a system called pymalloc, which organizes memory into pools for faster and more efficient access.\n",

        "-  Except Block : Handle the exception by writing the code inside an except block. You can catch specific exceptions or multiple types.\n",

        "-  Else Block (Optional) : Write the code inside an else block if one want to run something only when no exception occurs.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Finally Block (Optional) : Write the code inside a finally block if one want it to run no matter what, whether an exception happens or not (often used for cleanup tasks like closing files).\n",

        "\n",
        "-  Efficiency – Ensures optimal use of memory and system resources.\n",

        "-  Automatic Garbage Collection – Python cleans up unused objects, but understanding it helps avoid issues.\n",

        "-   Reference Counting:Every object in Python has a reference count (how many variables point to it).When the count drops to zero, the object is deleted immediately.\n",
        "-  Garbage Collector for Circular References:Some objects refer to each other (circular reference), so ref count never reaches zero.Python's gc module detects and collects these.\n",
        "-  Generational GC:Objects are grouped into generations (0, 1, 2).New objects start in Gen 0.If they survive collection, they move up.Gen 0 is collected most often; Gen 2 less often (older objects are less likely to be garbage).\n",
        "\n",
        "16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  The else block is used to define code that should run only if no exceptions occur in the try block. It helps separate the normal execution path from error handling, making the code cleaner and more readable.\n",

        "-  Closing a file in Python is very important because of the following reasons :\n",

        "\n",
        "-  **Flushes Data to Disk** : When you write to a file, the data is first stored in a buffer (in-memory).file.close() flushes the buffer, ensuring all data is actually written to disk.Not closing the file might result in data loss or corruption, especially in write mode.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  **Avoids File Locks or Conflicts** : Some OSes lock files when they are open for writing.If the file is not closed, other processes might not be able to access it properly.\n",

        "These occur when objects are no longer needed but are still referenced, preventing garbage collection. This can lead to increased memory usage over time.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Circular References:\n",
        "When two or more objects refer to each other, it creates a reference cycle that the garbage collector may not immediately resolve. Using the weakref module can help in such cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  High Memory Consumption:\n",
        "Python objects are memory-heavy due to dynamic typing and object overhead. This becomes noticeable in data-heavy or long-running applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):\n",

        "\n",
        "-  In Python, we can raise an exception manually using the raise keyword. This is useful when we want to enforce specific conditions or signal that an error has occurred during program execution.Additionally, we can define and raise custom exceptions by creating a new class that inherits from the Exception class.This approach makes error handling more meaningful and maintainable, especially in large applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications ?\n",
        "\n",
        "-  Multithreading is important in certain applications because it allows multiple tasks to run concurrently within a single process. This improves the responsiveness and efficiency of programs, especially those that involve I/O-bound operations like file access, network communication, or user interaction.For example, in a web server, multithreading enables handling multiple client requests at the same time without blocking. Similarly, in a GUI application, it allows the interface to remain responsive while background tasks are running.Even though Python’s Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) restricts true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks in CPython, multithreading still provides significant performance benefits in I/O-bound scenarios by reducing idle time.Using multithreading properly can lead to faster execution, better resource utilization, and improved user experience."
